  <article class="container container-left">
  <p>Before diving into which DAOs to join or how to explore based on your interest areas, you need to understand that DAOs are permissionless. It’s extremely easy to join most of them by just entering into their discord, hold a token if they demand you to else you can just start contributing. You don’t need anyone’s permission to contribute.
  </p>
  <p>Just keep sharing what you can, show the proof of work or whatever skill you have, join them on their mission and you are in!</p>

<h3>How to get in?</h3>
<ol>
<li>Find your Tribe</li>

<p>It’s important to know which environment and group of people would you want to hang around where you can feel that you truly belong there. Usually, DAOs have their communities on either Discord or Slack and once you join, you can check out the channels, the work being done, who are the members and contributors, etc. Check the vibe - see what kind of interactions are people having, ask yourself if you’re able to develop a connection or at least any inclination towards them?
</p>

<li>Go through their ‘About Us’ section</li>

<p> DAOs have a specific purpose due to which they exist. The members believe in a certain set of ideas where they work together to attain a common goal. To get a gist of this, you should read what the DAO is about, what do they believe in, what are their core values, etc. so that you don’t have any unrealistic expectations and have a clear idea of which community are you joining. It also talks about members' rights and responsibilities, as well as the correct procedure for proposals, elections, and voting.
</p>

<li>Choose your discipline</li>

<p>Some common roles that exist in most of the DAOs are (a non-exhaustive list):
<ul>
<li>Community Management</li>
<li>Business Development</li>
<li>Designers/Artists</li>
<li>Developers</li>
<li>Treasurers</li>
<li>Product Managers</li>
<li>Writers</li>
<li>Governance</li>
<li>Marketing and PR</li>
<li>Operations</li>
and more...
</ul>
<p>Having a clear idea of the role that you can pick up accelerates your progress in a DAO along with improving future prospects.</p>
</p>

<li>Getting Involved</li>

<p>Once you get in after checking out what the DAO is about, you need to start getting involved. You need to identify the goals that you want to achieve staying there. What skills/deliverables can you provide which can help the community grow? How much time can you dedicate to community projects? What community calls/events should you pay attention to? Which projects/initiatives attract you and where you’d like to contribute the most?

These are some questions that you might need to answer before you can start getting involved.

After you have some answers to these questions, start socializing. Talk to members, and contributors, and be like a kid who’s exploring a new world. Get to know how things are working there. Chat with them on DMs, set up a call where you can ask your doubts, and get some ideas about what you can do. Join community meetups, introduce & interact with people to get the context of the ongoing projects.
</p>

<li>Acquiring Tokens</li>

<p>In order to vote for any proposal or participate in a decision-making process, you need to have some tokens that a DAO issues. In some DAOs, decision-making can be open but in others, it can be gated. Your voting power might also depend on the number of tokens that you hold. One can acquire tokens by either:
<ul>
<li>Purchasing from an exchange</li>
<li> Completing some bounties or tasks for which the DAO awards tokens</li> 
<li> Participating in a funding activity that gives you access based on your level of contribution.</li> 
</ul>
</p>
</ol>

<h3>Getting Paid by DAOs</h3>
From earning in fiat to earning in crypto and getting some ownership is something that makes the ecosystem super exciting. Earning ownership in communities or protocols can create an insane level of advantage in the longer run. Let’s explore the ways in which you can do so:
<ul>
<li>Grants:</li>
<p>
Members or anyone who can build game-changing products or offer any valuable service are awarded grants in order to support them and promote them. Many DAOs like Compound and Aave have pools to distribute grants to these amazing builders so that they can continue to grow the space.
</p>

<li>Full-Time roles:</li>

<p>Just like traditional companies, DAOs offer full-time roles but one requires to prove themselves with some solid proof of work to grab an opportunity like this. They are usually paid in stable coins like $USDT, and $DAI and sometimes they are also paid some bonuses. Compensation for such contributors can go to millions.
</p>

<li>Bounties:</li>
<p>
These are some specific, standalone tasks that allow not-so-regular or new individuals to get a taste of the space. If they add some solid value or complete the given task in the best way possible, they are declared winners and are compensated(in native tokens) accordingly. Examples: Layer3, SuperteamDAO, Gitcoin, etc.

Bounties help the ecosystem grow rapidly since many members participate in it, but their work out on the internet is consumed by various people around the world.
</p>

<li>Revenue Sharing:</li>
<p>
Suppose a DAO launches a merch, NFT project, service, or any product, and they generate revenue, the community members get a cut from this. The proceeds are distributed amongst builder(s), contributors, and members, and some part is allocated towards the treasury. This happens in a few DAOs only right now but we could definitely see more DAOs following in the future.
</p>
</ul>
Joining a DAO and contributing has infinite upsides and zero downsides. Just a few hours of volunteer work can open up some huge opportunities plus rewards in the web3 space. Only time will tell how things will unfold further but surely there’s a lot to come.
